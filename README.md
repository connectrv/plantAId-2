# plantAId-2

Plant Aid 2 has 2 different parts:

CropBot/DiseaseBot:
Disease Bot is a NLP and ML based ChatBot for farmers to understand disasters they might undergo. Use our CropBot Zip file to access the contents, and we have provided additional files as well.

Plant Aid:
Plant Aid is an ML and Computer Vision app which allows Farmers to scan plants and get a diagnosis. They can also save their plants and diseases to a database where it can be accessed later.

P.S:
Our folder name is SkinCancer, this was our earlier idea for the hackathon but when we tried to change the name it corrupted all of our files, so we had to stick with it. Sorry!
